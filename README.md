# TasteDEX Intro

{% hint style="success" %}
**TasteDEX helps you make the most out of your crypto in three ways:**

**Trade, Earn, and Win.**
{% endhint %}

## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### Low fees

TasteDEX runs on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin.\
Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.\
Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, TasteDEX doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## 💸 Earn

> Earn DESIRE and other tokens for free with attractive interest rates.

### Earn tokens with Pools

Stake DESIRE and earn free tokens. DESIRE holders can earn free tokens each week from major projects. New projects join the platform every day so you can pick your favorite token to earn.

### Earn DESIRE with Farms

Stake LP tokens and earn DESIRE. Pick a token pair (e.g. USDT and TASTE) and stake your LP token of choice to earn DESIRE at high APRs.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn’t supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).

### Prediction

Win BNB if you can predict whether the TASTE/BNB price will rise or fall.\ We have competitions regularly so you can win even a higher price!

# ðŸ”„ Exchange

TasteDEX is an Automated Market Maker (AMM), and the Exchange is a crucial part of the TasteDEX. The TasteDEX Exchange offers several features that support decentralized trading:

### Swapping/Trading

TasteDEX lets users trade without the need to go through a Centralized Exchange. Everything you do on TasteDEX is routed directly through your own walletâ€”no need to trust someone else with your coins!

### Liquidity Pools

You can only swap tokens on TasteDEX if there is enough liquidity for those tokens. If nobody has added much liquidity for the token or tokens you want to swap, it will be difficult, expensive, or impossible to do so.

Providing liquidity will get you LP Tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees for making sure there's always liquidity for the exchange to use.

### Farming

Farming lets users that are providing liquidity earn DESIRE rewards by locking their LP tokens into a smart contract. The incentive is to balance out the risk of [impermanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained) that comes along with locking in your liquidity.

# How to Trade

Trading on TasteDEX is very easy compared to most exchanges. You aren't going to be overwhelmed by charts or jargon, and calculations are all handled for you.

### Getting set up to trade

Before you can trade, you will need a BNB Smart Chain-compatible wallet. You will also need to have some BEP20 tokens to trade with.&#x20;

### Trading on the TasteDEX exchange

1\. Go to the exchange page [here](https://swap.tastenfts.com/swap).

2\. Unlock your BNB Smart Chain-compatible wallet by clicking **Unlock Wallet** (you can also **Connect** in the top right-hand corner).

3\. Choose the token you want to trade from the dropdown menu in the "From" section. The default setting is BNB. Whichever token you choose, you will need to make sure you have some to trade with. Your balance is shown above the token dropdown menu.

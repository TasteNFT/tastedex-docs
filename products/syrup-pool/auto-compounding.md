# Auto DESIRE Pool

## Stake DESIRE, earn DESIRE!

You've now got two delicious flavors of DESIRE-DESIRE Pool to choose from: Auto-compounding, and Manual. Read on to learn more!

### What’s the difference between the “Auto DESIRE Pool” and the “Manual DESIRE Pool”? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86" id="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86"></a>

**With both pools, you can simply stake your DESIRE tokens to earn more DESIRE tokens.**

But there are some differences:

**Manual DESIRE**

* You need to harvest or compound (reinvest) your DESIRE by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of BNB for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
* Deposits [SYRUP Token](syrup-pool-faq.md#whats-syrup-token) to your wallet upon staking

**Auto DESIRE**

* Stake your DESIRE and forget about it! The DESIRE you stake in this Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.

### What are the fees for the Auto DESIRE Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

**Unstaking fee**

* **1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more DESIRE in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 DESIRE, then 0.02 DESIRE would be subtracted as the performance fee.

The DESIRE collected via the unstaking fee and performance fee goes to the treasury for TasteDEX operations.

### What's the best way to use the Auto DESIRE Pool? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520" id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Simple: stake your DESIRE, but only withdraw after 72 hours (if you need to). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto DESIRE bounty?

**Auto DESIRE Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto DESIRE pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto DESIRE Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of DESIRE you receive will be greater than the BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
